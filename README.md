# NoOffice.org
New NoOffice.org web site for writing the ultimate book about remote working out in the open!

Tomasz will have to install it here!

The idea is this:

- Create a web site in Jekyll with Table of contents and nothing else. No blog. No nothing. Just Jekyll sites.
- Start filling out the table of contents with files written here.
- Ask for feedback as comments in the GitHub repository
- Pull requests also via GitHub
- Later translations also via GitHub.

## Folder structure:

- README
- Index - TOC
- /book/ - English version of the book
- /chapters/ - when all the finished chapters will be compiled
