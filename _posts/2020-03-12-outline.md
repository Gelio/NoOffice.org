Just today finally imported a whole new outline on the book done on my iPad Pro in the Mind Node application:

[Here's the commit](https://github.com/Nozbe/NoOffice.org/commit/621f07fa537ef3aedabd5a2f8cfd8380e6eecd95) responsible for that. Later I decided to fix some "Table of Contents" issues and now you can see the whole thing online:

[Table of contents with an outline of the No Office book](/book/)

And now it's just the time to write it all up. I'll be doing it over the next week. Wish me luck - lots of writing ahead of me!
