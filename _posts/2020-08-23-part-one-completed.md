title: Part one completed, new languages and more updates!
---

Today I finished the last chapter on [Mighty Fridays](/book/friday) of the [Part 1](/book/one) of the book. Now I have [17 Chapters written](/book/) and still another 15 to write. Iâ€™m more than half way through. Which is great!

[Check out the Table of Contents and start reading!](/book/)

But there's more!

We've got our first community-driven contribution and the translation of the book to [Brazilian Portuguese has started](/br).

And next week we'll have first chapters translated to [Polish](/pl), [Spanish](/es) and [Japanese](/jp) so stay tuned!

I've updated the [about page](/about) of the project to reflect that.

I'm so excited. The writing takes a lot of my time but to see the book spreading so quickly even though it's not finished yet gives me hope for the future of this project!

Now it's time for part 2 - where I really dive deep into true #NoOffice habits and techniques. Wish me luck!
