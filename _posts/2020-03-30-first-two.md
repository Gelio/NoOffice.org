title: "Intro and the first two chapters written!"
---

Finally after the whole COVID-19 situation has settled (and we're finally getting the hang of the situation), I'm back at writing the book. Just wrote the intro and the first two chapters. Here's to more writing tomorrow!

I've decided to be very lean about it - write as fast as I can and let Magda edit my writing as soon as she can. I want to be as "lean" as possible with the book.
