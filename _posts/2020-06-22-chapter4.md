title: "Part 1 intro and chapter 4"
---

Finally got back to the groove of writing the book. I cannot postpone it anymore. I was busy launching [Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/) but now I'm back in writing mode.

Finalized the [Part 1 intro - you're using office wrong](/book/one) and the [Chapter 4: focus](/book/focus) and now I'm hoping to get to a regular rhythm of writing 500 words a day for the rest of June.
