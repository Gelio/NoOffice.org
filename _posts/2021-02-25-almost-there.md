title: Almost there! 90% of the book is written!
---

Today I finished chapter [30 on security](/security) and I’m hoping to be done with the entire book early March. I can’t wait to have the book written and completed. However, after that the real work will begin of promoting the book!

<!--More-->

I’ve also simplified the URLs on this site, so if you want to read each chapter, you just add a name of the page and go there, like this for example:

* Entire book's Table of Contents: [/book](/book)
* Chapter 7 on Meetings: [/meetings](/meetings)
* Chapter 18 on Trust: [/trust](/trust)
* ... and so on!

P.S. As you might have noticed, I haven't been posting updates on this blog much as I'm mostly writing on my personal blog [michael.team](https://michael.team) more. But I've been writing the book consistentnly over the last months.
