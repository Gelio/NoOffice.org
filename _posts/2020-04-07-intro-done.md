title: "Intro completely done!"
---

I managed to write the entire intro and I like it so far. Let's see what you think about it now.

This includes the [Intro beginning - Modern work is changing](/book/intro) as well as three intro chapters inside: [how my dream started](/book/dream), [how my team grew](/book/team) and why I believe [this is the future of work](/book/future).

Please read it and let me know what you think. [Start here](/book/intro). Thanks!
