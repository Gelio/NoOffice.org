### Review your and your team’s work every quarter

- Every quarter we review our stuff

- It’s not a quarterly perfrmance evaluation

- Here’s the process

	- Revisit goals

	- revisit hopes and dreams

	- Revisit quarter

	- How much you can accomplish in a year!

- here’s a document template

- We schedule meetings one-on-one

	- Questions we ask

	- What’s in your personal life - how are your children, wife stuff?

	- We go through the document

- We publish the most important findings in a vlog

- One thing:

	- Stop for a day and review last quarter and plan the next one - to make sure you can correct course, re-focus and re-commit to things
