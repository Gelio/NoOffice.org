- Started being disorganized

	- Moved to Warsaw

	- Built Nozbe

	- It resonated with people

	- Became my main project

	- After a year as side-project, wanted to hire a dev

	- Wasn’t ready to “live the startup dream” and open an office. Didn’t see the point.

	- 1 year into Nozbe, I decided to make it my day job

	- Still was hoping I could continue work wherever I wanted

	- Didn’t want to constrain myself

- Was ready to build a team behind this Nozbe product

	- I also needed some help - I decided to hire a programmer

	- Remembered the “Mitarbeiter” word - was looking for partners in crime :-)

	- Was focused on getting the best person for the job, was hoping they’d be in Warsaw

- Meet Tom

	- I went with the best one I could get - and he happened to be a student from a city 200 miles away from Warsaw

	- I didn’t want to build an office in Warsaw, I didn’t see the point

	- We met and we started working together

	- Said he wanted to work on something challenging but didn’t want to go to any office - was finishing college

	- Two years later after he graduated from university and got married, he moved back to his home town

	- Now he lives in his home town, has a wife and 2 kids and is still constantly being challenged by me

- Meet Hubert

	- Looking for a great designer

	- The best one was working at a firm in southern Poland

	- When I did the final interview, he told me how much he was earning... and I had to double his salary

	- Confirmed my dream - hire the best talent and give them a great work and salary... without making them move from the place they call home

	- He had offers from Warsaw in the past but he didn’t want to move. Now he didn’t have to

	- He’s still with us, living where he wants to live and works for a global company

- Meet Magda

	- She was living in Warsaw

	- At first, she was surprised not to have to go to an office every day

	- After half a year she got used to it

	- So much so that she asked if she could move to France

	- I asked if they had Internet in France

	- She lived in France for the next two years. I didn’t really notice

	- Now she’s back in Warsaw but it doesn’t matter as she keeps doing her work!

- Can I grow the team like this?

- Work is not a place to go, it’s a thing you... and everyone around you... is doing

	- So with No Office mentality, you can hire the best people for the job, and let them choose their lifestyle

	- You don’t have to constrain them to where you are. Let them have the best lifestyle possible - that’s the ultimate employee benefit
