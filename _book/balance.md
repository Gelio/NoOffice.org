### Deal with work-at-home challenges

- Not much time for yourself like in an office

	- Laundry

	- Cooking

	- Cleaning

	- Using time when

- Please you deal with this because you’re home

- My work is more important because I go to office. Yours is not. Because you’re at home

- Kids are sick - by default you have to stay at home

- It’s great if 2 people work from home, than they GET you.

- Family wants us to run errands for us!

	- And when you refuse, they get angry, because we’re supposed to do this for them - because we’re at home

	- But it’s just a moment!

		- But you get out of flow

		- 10 minute break is annoying because it takes 20 minutes to get back into flow.

		- Sometimes we’re rude

			- People find it offensive

			- People want to talk to us when they want to talk to us

- Communication with family members is key

	- Wife - finally we’re talking!

	- Why and how - explain why I’m taking a break in the middle of the day

	- Why I work the way I do and how I want to go about it

	- Talking about working hours with the family member to set expectations and boundaries

	- Decisions must be set together

	- Communication channel is also important

		- Ewelina uses Nozbe now and doesn’t send me messages

	- Explain that our work is ALSO work, it’s not sitting at home and we feel bad if we don’t do it right!

- Kids find it difficult to understand the boundaries of work.

	- When at home, they go into the home office and play

	- They play on my whiteboard and draw beautiful things

	- Setting up a light helps - they know I’m busy

- You don’t call in sick because you don’t have to, right?

	- I’m at home anyway and I have my office available right there

	- When you’re sick, you prefer to work - just less, maybe fewer hours, but once you’re in bed comfy and can think, you prefer to work actually.

- When both work from home

	- They respect the other person’s space and time

	- They understand the other one is focused

- One thing:

	- Talk to your family members that you’re actually working - don’t worry you’re not treated seriously by the neighbors - deal with it

That's why this chapter below I'll be sharing the best practices 

### Set up your work environment at home

	- Lunch 14-15

		- Some people have 2 hour lunch breaks to also run some errands

		- Very often we adjust to people who work in “traditional” offices

	- Lunch nap is useful

		- When I’m feeling bad, I just fall asleep

		- Later in the evening I’m working to take it back

	- There’s no pressure to work 9-5
