## Hey, Michael, are you trying to convince me to drop my office with this book?

I'm not telling you to do anything. I'm just trying to point out that an office should be perceived as an additional tool for you to help you get stuff done. When you look at your office this way, you might re-think its purpose and the way you're using it right now. And most importantly you'll re-think the way you work!

### This book is not about getting rid of office space but about working more effectively in a team, whether you have an office or not.

This book is about taking your team's productivity to a whole new level and showing you that the office space is not a requirement to do that. Taking our company and other #NoOffice companies as an example, my goal is to uncover the best practices for the team to communicate and get stuff done better. Even if not everyone is in the same physical space.

Ultimately remember that:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

## This book's goal is to change your mindset

After all, it's 2018. We have all this amazing technology and the iPhone in my pocket is more powerful than most laptops a few years ago. Yet with most people's mindset we're still stuck in thinking that we need an office to do business. That without an office there's no business. And that remote work is only for unicorns.

> With this book let's try to design the most effective way to work and communicate in a team during these modern times.

So let's start with the key to team's success - internal communication - in the next part of this book.
