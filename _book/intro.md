Most of the knowledge workers worldwide waste two hours a day on average to commute to the officeâ€¦ to do the work they could easily do from their homes. Are you one of them? Isn't it ridiculous that with all the technology available, companies still force people to come to the office every single day just to work in front of the computer and attend meetings? It's not the office that gets the work done. It's people. And to act effectively, they usually need long stretches of "focused time," also called "the flow", and not fancy, open-space, loft-like-designed offices. In many cases, an equation between the two: work = office is painfully false.

This book is my guide to getting it all done from a distance. After more than 13 years of leading a team completely remotely and close to 20 years working from home myself, I believe I've got some experience to share, and I know people need this stuff now more than ever.

Additionally, I'm a productivity fanatic. After all, I'm building Nozbe and Nozbe Teams - apps that help people and teams get awesome things done. Even (or especially) when these people are not sharing the same geographical space.

Coronavirus spread or not - the times are really changing. We've got a super advanced technology. We've got a new generation of people who get this technology. We've got the goods.

Now, all we need is to ditch the idea of a physical office being a requirement for businesses rather than a tool. Only this way we can get people to work the way they want and choose a lifestyle they desire.

So why not give it a shot?

## The one thing

Before you start, if this book leaves you with just one takeaway, I want it to be this:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

After each chapter in this book, you'll receive one key takeaway. One thing. One thought. One tip. Or one tweak you can implement today. I hope you'll use it.

## The book has four sections

There's an intro, two main parts, and an outro:

**Introduction** where you can learn why I decided to work completely remotely with my team from the very beginning and why I believe this is a future of teamwork.

**Part ONE** where you'll learn how to work more effectively as a team. Whether you have an office or not. A few very modern working practices that you can implement now and improve your team's overall productivity today.

**Part TWO** which shows you how to work with a team that is entirely distributed. How to work at home, have a nomadic lifestyle, hire remotely and lead a team whose members don't see each other every day. It's both for remote workers (or people who occasionally work from home) and for their managers or bosses.

**Outro** is where we finish it all off and summarize this book. And thank everyone who helped me get it to the finish line.

OK, let's start!
