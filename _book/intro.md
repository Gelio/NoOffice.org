## Even if your company has a physical office space - you should read this book!

This book isn't aimed only at people and teams interested in remote work. It's based on more than a decade of experience running an all-remote company but as you'll see in the upcoming chapters, my main argument is that an office is not a requirement for a business to be successful. Yes, an office can be a useful tool, but it's completely optional. What really matters is the way you're working together in a team towards common goals. Because:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

After the [acknowledgements](/book/acknowledgements) please go straight to [Introduction](/book/introduction) where you'll learn the main premise of this book - that you can run a very successful company with or without an office. Good luck!
