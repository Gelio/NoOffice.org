This is 2020. Times are a-changing. Faster than we ever thought possible due to the COVID-19 outbreak. I've always wanted to write a book about successfully managing an all-remote team but I've never had the time to do it. Now that almost everyone has been forced to go "work from home" and all teams are essentially "remote", I've ditched all the plans I had for this year and decided to finally let it all out.

This book is my guide to getting it all done from a distance. After more than 13 years of leading a team completely remotely and close to 20 years working from home, I've got some experience to share and people need this stuff more than ever.

Additionally I'm a productivity fanatic. After all I'm building Nozbe and Nozbe Teams - apps that help people and teams get awesome things done.

Listen up - virus or not - the times are really changing. We've got a super advanced technology. We've got a new generation of people. We've got the goods. And by making an office a tool and not a requirement for businesses, we can offer everyone quality, flexibility and an amazing lifestyle. So why not give it a shot?

## The one thing

Before you start, if this book leaves you with just one takeaway, I want it to be this:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

After each chapter in this book you'll receive ONE takeaway from the chapter. One thought, or one tip or one tweak you can implement today. I hope you'll use it.

## The book has four sections

There's an intro, two main parts and an outro:

**Introduction** where you can learn why I decided to work completely remotely with my team from the very beginning and why I believe this is a future of teamwork.

**Part ONE** where you'll learn how to work more effectively as a team. Whether you have an office or not. Just good and very modern working practices that you can implement now and improve your team's overall productivity.

**Part TWO** which shows you how to work with a team that is completely distributed. How to work at home, have a nomadic lifestyle, hire remotely and lead a team that doesn't see each other every day. It's both for remote workers (or people who occasionally work from home) and for their managers or bosses.

**Outro** is where we finish it all off and summarize this book. And thank everyone who helped me get it to the finish line.

OK, let's start!
