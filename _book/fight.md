### Fight, argue and commit!

- Shape up - fall in love with the problem - not solution

- Strong opinions weekly held

- Argue your case - don’t go personal

- You’re not the smartest person in the room - nobody is

- Find a bunch of people who feel safe around each other

	- Directors

	- DF team

- Invite only the fewest people possible

	- Steve Jobs threw out someone who doesn’t contribute

	- No status, no ego, trim people

	- Try to find variety of people

- Disagree and commit

	- Take your ego out of equation

	- Commit and don’t allow - I told you so’s

	- It was his/her idea!

- All decisions are temporary

	- Don’t over argue

	- Try and revisit

	- Find metrics to measure if it makes sense

- Design Fight
