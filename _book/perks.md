## Don't make the office a place where people want to hang out

Especially in my industry, the IT and Internet startup world, it's cool to show off your office. The attention to details, the vending machines, the fuss-ball table, the chill-out room, the fitness-space, the console-corner... you name it. All these things are supposed to make people feel better about being in an office.

Office is for work, not for hanging out.

I remember my first visit at the famous *Googleplex*, the offices of Google in Mountain View. I was blown away by all the *free* stuff they'd get. Sport installations, restaurants, vending machines, massage armchairs, laundry services... everything that would make a Google employee NOT to want to go home. Yet their office spaces were crammed and very often with *open office* layout that promotes distractions.

I didn't get it why Google, the place where supposedly the smartest people in the world work, on one hand was so generous giving lavishly all these perks, but on the other hand, wasn't investing in proper workplaces themselves.

## Perks should focus on helping people work better

If you want to invest in your people and give them real perks, give them bigger desks, more space between each other or ideally private offices, comfortable armchairs, stand-up desks, two or three additional monitors, ergonomic keyboards, bigger whiteboards and acoustically-isolated conference rooms.

These things really make people work better.

## Additional perks should focus on letting people *have a life* outside of work!

Instead of keeping people in the office, help them get out of it. Once they're done with work, feel free to support their hobbies, their families, their vacation time.

I'll be digging deeper into this in the second part of this book, but one of the problems I'm facing as a leader of an all-remote team, is the fact that people work too much!

Yes, the biggest struggle for a person who works from home is the work-life balance. That's why a true #NoOffice company is focused on supporting people's life outside of work. Otherwise they'll burn out and then you will have a completely another set of problems.

## Don't give stuff out entirely for free!

My experience has taught me is that when people get stuff for free, they don't appreciate it that much. That's why we subsidize things. Depending on the situation we usually cover around 50% of the net price and 100% of all the additional taxes and costs for most of the perks we offer. Here are some examples:

* Want a new computer? Choose any computer you want, we pay half of it, you pay the other half.
* Want a new desk? New armchair? Additional monitor? Find the one you want, we'll cover one half and the taxes. We'll also offer financing, because you can pay your 50% in a few installments over a few months. Interest free, of course.

Depending on the thing people buy, after 2 years this computer, smartphone, office appliance becomes theirs. We'd take it off our company's books and they can then keep it, sell it, or give it away. Ask your tax advisor about the details.

What we've found is that people prefer to own the equipment they work with and if they can get it for half the price, they really appreciate it. Also, when people work on the equipment they own, they simply care about it much more than if it was given to them for free by the company.

## With perks you can encourage people to change behavior and build good habits

We also support things like this:

* English classes - most of our team members' mother tongue is not English but Polish, but our official team-wide language is indeed English, so we pay for English lessons up until a certain amount per month. The employee covers the rest if they go above it.
* Gym memberships - we negotiate special gym rates and thanks to that we can get a gym membership at a better rate than an employee would ever get. And then we ask them to pay for only half of it. Also races like runs, triathlons or other competitions. This way we promote sports in the team.
* Conferences, online courses and books - these things are free for everyone up until some threshold and later they're subsidized by the company. In my team we're all learners and we are happy to spend money to learn something new.

There are more ideas and things we haven't tried yet. Some companies offer every X years a full month-long sabbatical for a team member so that they can totally disconnect from work and recharge. Others offer a fully-paid or subsidized hobby stipend which means that if someone wants to learn something that has nothing to do with their work, the company will support it and help them pay for it.

## Let people share what they do outside of work

We also have a culture of sharing what we do on weekends or outside of work. We send pictures of our hobbies, accomplishments and other non-work related projects in our #random chat channel. When we meet in person on our bi-yearly reunions (more on that later in this book), we even prepare presentations showing off our hobbies. We want people to be more than just their job description.

## Let people donate to charity from company's profits!

Every month as we pay our income taxes at Nozbe, we **put aside 3% of the profits** for charity. We wire it to a special bank account and this way every month the *charity fund* grows.

This is no longer our money. This belongs to charity and it's ready to be given away.

### Twice a year, 500 EUR to give

Twice a year we give everyone on the team 500 EUR from our charity fund to spend on any cause they want to support. They can give this money to someone they know is in need, to support a local non-profit, animal shelter, foundation, whatever they want. In many situations, 500 EUR which is around $600 US dollars goes a long way of helping someone or some cause. And sometimes one team member finds a very nice cause and others join in, so the impact is pretty big.

### Our company matches private donations, too.

Additionally, if someone supports a cause from their own pocket, we will match it up until 500 EUR from our charity fund. This way we can contribute to a cause that one of our team members is truly passionate about and help in a meaningful way.

### Whenever there is a cause, we can help!

Having a charity fund like this gives us this freedom of donating money whenever we feel there's a worthy cause. And there are so many causes and so many people in need.

Because this money is being wired to our separate bank account at the moment of paying the taxes, emotionally we don't feel it's our company's money anymore. We've said good bye to it already and we can be generous and spend it on something good, this way giving back to the society.

## The one thing: choose perks that truly help people!

The perks shouldn't be sneaky ways of keeping people working more. They already work too much, and if they don't, you've got more serious problems in the team that the perks won't solve. Perks and non-salary benefits should focus on helping people be better people. They should be encouraged to have a life outside of work. Only this way they'll be truly motivated to give their best at work.
