## To work better, take time off more!

The *hustle culture* is very popular now. No pain no gain. Work work work. Sleep is for the weak. If you're not working, your slacking off. Right?

Wrong.

Study after study show that both sleeping (getting a good 7-8 hours sleep) and taking time off makes you more productive. Encourages out-of-the-box thinking. Helps you come up with better and more creative ideas.

Rest is critical. Taking time off is key.

But it's not easy. In America, young employees on average get about 10 paid vacation days per year and only after 20 years at work they can hope to get to around 20[^2]. In Japan the government established many official holidays, because hardly anyone takes the mandated 10 days of paid vacations[^3]. In Europe the situation is much better, with many countries requiring by law that the employees take 20 or more vacation days.

My home country of Poland mandates 21 or 26 paid vacation days, depending on employee seniority, and by law people should take at least one two-week holiday break.

## Why taking time off is so hard yet so important?

Because there's always so much to do! Also, when you're running a small company you feel like you don't have enough resources to go around. Some things just don't happen if people are away.

This is a common pitfall and I was guilty of it. I remember my first years of running Nozbe when I was first alone, then we were 3 and I still felt I needed to be there all the time. Checking my email. Checking my tasks. Checking everything.

I remember going on a two-week vacation with my pregnant wife. It was our last vacation as a married couple without kids because our daughter was going to be born in just a few months. It was supposed to be a great time for both of us, but my wife got increasingly frustrated as I couldn't let go of thinking about my company. It took me more than a week to finally fully disconnect. It was hard. I knew then I had to change the way I was running my business.

The problem is that the bad habits we develop when running a small company will eventually scale with the business! If you overwork, you'll keep overworking. If your company is not prepared to function a few days without you, it simply won't.

And everyone needs rest. Just like I mentioned in the previous chapter about socializing, we need to have a life outside of work. This includes traveling, hanging out with the family, enjoying reading a good novel. We need the time to disconnect.

And the business needs to work without us. Maybe not at full speed, but it should be able to function anyway. Even if you're a freelancer where you are the business, you still need to recharge between gigs.

## Good vacation policy and practices

Over the years we've tried different things and we've been taking advice from many companies. Here are my best tips and tricks regarding implementing paid vacation time in a team:

### Make sure people get enough paid vacation days

Please don't follow the American or Japanese averages. I believe at least 20 days of paid vacation days should be a worldwide standard.

We have recently reviewed our policies and decided to make it equal for everyone on the team. This way we can also attract young talent with our fairly generous 27 paid vacation days.

In some companies when you haven't used your vacation days, you can get paid an equivalent of that. We don't allow that. We don't want to exchange people's unused vacation time for money. We really want them to take the days off and rest.

### Plan longer two or even three weeks of vacation

People on the team need to know that taking the time off for two or even three weeks is completely OK. The business should be ready for that.

However, people are still reluctant to plan longer vacations.

That's why while having our quarterly reviews (see Chapter 16) we check their current vacation situation and if they haven't planned a longer holiday in the first half of the year, we insist on planning one in the second half. At least one two-week holiday is a must and we try to work with our team members to enable them to have even three weeks off. Such longer holidays require more planning for everyone involved but people report much more refreshed and energized for work after being out for such a long period of time. They actually start missing work then.

OK, DONE FOR TODAY, TOMORROW MORE...
