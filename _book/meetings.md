### Make Meetings regular but optional

- Make meetings regular - put them on schedule

- Clear expectations

	- Agenda

	- Set time when the agenda is published

	- Meeting documents must be published!

- Documents/notes before the meeting have to be published

	- Like Jeff Bezos meeting notes

	- Give people hours before the meeting - previous day rule

	- Need to be able to comment on stuff in the note - G docs or Paper or whatever.

	- This way discussion can happen before the meeting already so the meeting is clearer

	- No brainstorming on meetings - always initial concept must be there.

	- When brainstorming happens, make sure to take notes and when it gets too far or too long - stop and designate a person whoâ€™d take it from here

- What are meetings for?

	- On meeting we discuss the points of tension, not the entire document or concept

- Status meetings

	- For direct reports - to reconnect, see challenges

	- For dev team - to reconnect and talk about challenges for the week

	- We run both on Mondays

	- We question them now

- Limit people

	- Steve Jobs famously threw people away from a meeting

	- Only the people really necessary for it

- One thing

	- Avoid in-promptu meetings

	- Get the meetings prepared and ready - everyone participating must be there
