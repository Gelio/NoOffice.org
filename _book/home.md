	- Signs that busy

	- IKEA light

- Foods

	- Do breakfast

	- And prepare lunch already

- Working hours

	- Evening - 1-2 hours because kids are asleep

		- Quiet because people are away

	- Lunch 14-15

		- Some people have 2 hour lunch breaks to also run some errands

		- Very often we adjust to people who work in “traditional” offices

	- Lunch nap is useful

		- When I’m feeling bad, I just fall asleep

		- Later in the evening I’m working to take it back

	- There’s no pressure to work 9-5

		- So taking it easy and if I don’t have to work continuously - I can take breaks

		- But then have to make up for them in the evening.

	- Half-time work

		- Professor at the University

		- Individual lessons

		- Prioritize the work that’s stable

	- Quarterly review is helpful

		- Reviewing journaling

		- Seeing how much we work

		- Adjusting and learning from mistakes

- Trust is contagious

	- We want to work full 8 hours

	- We don’t want to “cheat” the system even though we can because nobody’s watching

- One thing:

	- Create a great work environment at home with clear boundaries - be vigilant to see what works and what doesn’t. Constantly tweak your settings
