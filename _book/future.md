Now you know my story and how my dream of a "no office" lifestyle became a team that doesn't commute to a central office to get their work done. The only question that remains is about the future - is this just a future of my company or is this the future of work?

## Is modern, flexible and geographically dispersed team the future of work?

The cities are growing. Even in a developed country like the USA, when you look at the [top 20 most populated cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population), you can see that in the last decade all of the cities are growing. Only Chicago grew by less than 1%, but some cities like Phoenix, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin or Seattle grew way in double digits, some more than 20%! Is this really necessary? Don't we finally have technology 

- Is No Office a future of my company... or is it a future of work?

	- Cities are growing - but do they have to? Can you choose your own lifestyle?

	- Talented people know their value - they dictate how they want to live - you adapt to them

	- Open offices are distracting and stressful, feels like a factory floor - the best and the brightest don’t want to work like this

	- Commuting to work is stressful - even if you’re not stuck in a traffic jam

	- Think about it - you’re spending an hour one day to go to an office where you have to work in front of a computer?

	- Coronavirus shows sometimes we have to adapt

	- Many companies need to go hybrid mode - a small office, a small production facility... and everyone else

- We’re a small company, right?

	- 23 and counting

	- Buffer has 80+

	- Zapier has 250

	- InVision has 1000

	- Wordpress has 1000+

	- Gitlab has more than 1000

	- Companies big and small can work in a NoOffice way

	- Any knowledge worker can work like this - if you work with your brain, it doesn’t matter where it is.

	- However it’s not easy, that’s why I wrote this guide :-) It’s different and once it’s a natural way for the team, it’s actually very easy.

- There are challenges

	- It’s not all cupcakes and rainbows

	- How to set up your home office?

	- How to communicate internally?

	- How to get stuff done together?

	- How to run meetings, projects and work effectively?

	- How to re-connect and take care of good team spirits?

- I don’t have all the answers

	- Coronavirus sped up the work on this book

	- We’ve learned enough

	- The book is open sourced - so it will be updated

	- There are tools, and Nozbe Teams is one of them, but the processes and good practices are required

- Who is this book for

	- Employees and team members who are experimenting with remote work or want their employer to invite this

	- All business owners and managers - who are open to not only embrace remote work but also modern techniques of effective working

- There’s no office, there’s only work!

	- Matrix essay

	- Work is not a place to go, it’s a thing that you do

	- Because of that, the first part of this book is how to work better, with or without the office - practices that I believe any companies should implement

	- One thing: Office is just a tool, and you can bend it any way you want, because what’s real is work to do.
