### Help people find FOCUS at work

- We live in era of interruption

- It’s not that we don’t have enough time

	- We don’t have enough focused time.

- What’s destroying focus?

	- People who work as knowledge workers are there to use their head - their minds - their professional expertise

	- And how can they do it, if they’re stuck in meetings, bombarded with emails and notifications and don’t have enough focused time to produce true results?

	- Managers don’t help them - as they invent meetings and interrupt these workers

- How to find focus?

	- Instead of creating them as much space as possible for focused work

	- Ask for permission

	- Question each meeting, one-on-one session

	- Set up regular intervals between meetings so that people can plan their work

	- Protect your people - fight for their focused time

	- Disable notifications to minimum

	- Communicate expectations

- Maximizing every team member’s focused time should be manager’s top priority

- Don’t do open offices!

	- No “creative flow” bullshit

	- Let people work in a focused way - separate them

	- Join them in cafeteria or other spaces between dedicated work environment

	- go “library mode” if you can help it

	- My wife’s team refused to work in an open office and because they’re the core business of their work, the management had to listen to them.

- If work is not a place to go, but a thing that you do - make sure you really do it - and that people who are working with you are doing it, too.

- One thing:

	- Guard your people’s focused time

	- Do everything in your power to maximize their focused time
