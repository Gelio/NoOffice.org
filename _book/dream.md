- I fell in love with the Internet

- I always liked to travel and get to know languages

- I studied in Germany, then Spain then Poland

	- Even though I was away, I had a laptop with me and was in touch with my friends, collaborated on projects, etc.

- Wrote my thesis on teleworking and virtual companies

	- Inspired by my new lifestyle

	- Learned the quote and it stuck

- When I got married we moved to Dusseldorf Germany, then Bruxelles Belgium, then Frankfurt Germany

- How I followed my wife

	- Before I married my wife I visited her in Germany

	- She’d attend university and I’d ride a bike and use the free internet there to work on my laptop

	- After we married she got an internship in Brussels, we moved there and I worked from home as she wen to the offices

	- Then we moved to Frankfurt, where I’d work from home as well.

	- Then we settled in Warsaw, I worked from our apartment

	- When we got our first child, I went out to work at McDonald’s -  free internet and cheap, but good coffee was hard to beat

	- Now we live on the Spanish coast and I run my company from Spain

- Following my wife, living the dream - my customers in Spain, Germany and Poland

- Can I live like this for the rest of my life?

- One thing - Work is not a place to go, it’s a thing that you do - and thanks to the Internet, it can be done everywhere!
