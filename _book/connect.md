### Make sure people connect regularly

- Regular meetings via video conferencing

	- Video chat is key

	- You want to see them, see how they’re like, catch non-verbal communication

	- We hardly use voice anymore - we want to see each other

	- We feel more connected than ever

- Monday is for connection

	- Just like Friday is for review

	- Monday is all about connecting with your team

	- Our devs have 30-1h scrum every Monday

	- Directors have a 1-2 hour catch-up meeting

	- These meetings have no agenda, no written minutes... are about re-connection, but that’s OK

- Schedule one-on-one meetings

	- Project at Nozbe with every person as a task

	- Repeats every half a year

	- I put in comments what we talked about

	- It’s just to catch up and see what’s up

	- Have a personal connection with the boss

	- To replicate this met-in-corridor thingy

	- I ask first about a time that’s good for them

	- I schedule it and prepare coffee

	- We just chat - I have a few talking points about life, work, etc.

	- Friendly - no evaluation no nothing.

- Regular meetings help

	- If no agenda, it’s cancelled

	- If cancelled too often, prepare agenda point so that we have a reason to meet

	- Happened to us on DF once - for an entire month

- No Office loneliness is real

	- However you are deceived if you think at the office people really talk to other people all that much

	- Usually you hang out with the same crowd all the time

	- With this effort I connect with everyone

- One thing:

	- Cultivate one-on-one relationships with people, be vigilant if people start feeling lonely - as much as I encourage to avoid meetings, some are just necessary to keep it real

	- Further reading?
