## Even if your company has a physical office space - you should read this book!

This book isn't aimed only at people and teams interested in remote work. It's based on more than a decade of experience running an all-remote company but as you'll see in the upcoming chapters, my main argument is that an office is not a requirement for a business to be successful. Yes, an office can be a useful tool, but it's completely optional. What really matters is the way you're working together in a team towards common goals. Because:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

After the [acknowledgements](/book/acknowledgements) please go straight to [Introduction](/book/introduction) where you'll learn the main premise of this book - that you can run a very successful company with or without an office. Good luck!

## Why an all-remote team can be successful... and work better!

Let's start this book with some key benefits of #NoOffice - with this introduction you will both get why and how this works and that you can quickly implement the basic ideas from this book in your company right now.

What I mean by "#NoOffice" is a team or company that doesn't have a central office where people go to - where everyone on the team works remotely from their homes, the road or co-working spaces. Alternatively I'll be using the term "all-remote" to describe the same thing.

Before we start, let me introduce myself and explain in one paragraph why I've written this book for you:

## Hi, I'm Michael, the CEO and founder of Nozbe

I've been running my #NoOffice company for more than a decade now. Nozbe to put simply is a to-do app for teams used by more than half a million users from all over the world. With our software we help people and teams get stuff done better. We are all about productivity when it comes to both our product and the way we do things. This book will be focus on the latter - on how we work together as an all-remote team to create a successful company.

## Not only our team is all-remote, our customers are, too!

This book will show you how we're running an all-remote team of close to 30 people and more than 10 additional collaborators, all spread across different cities and countries, crossing many time zones.

Our customers are all-remote, too! Even though much of our team is scattered across Europe, our main chunk of customers comes from the USA, Canada and Australia. We also have lots of Nozbe users from Japan and many countries in Europe including Poland, Germany, Spain and the UK.

With both our customers and our team members from all over the world, where should we have built an office? Would it even make any sense at all? Well, not really because:

> "Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do!"

Yes, your job is not where you're going. Your job is what you're doing. You don't "go to your job", you just "do your job". Right?

### No. We're not unicorns or snowflakes!

Whenever I tell this story to anyone they're like:

> "Yeah Michael, that's nice that you have this small team of 20-30 people and you can work remotely. It works for you but you're so special... You have just this one simple product and nothing else... your business is not complicated... while our business is very much so - we are a serious business with serious needs and one of them is to have a serious office where everyone goes to!"

First off, my business is not that simple - in theory we have only one software package called "Nozbe" but in practice we have different apps for all the major platforms that we support (Web, Mac, Windows, Android, iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch) and we offer them in 11 major languages and on the billing side we let our customers pay us in 7 different currencies and on top of that we need to run a major server infrastructure on 3 continents to make sure our customers' data is synced and secure. So no. Not as simple as you might think. And the last time I saw a unicorn was on my daughter's drawing.

### No, we don't need to grow up!

When people downplay our business what they're basically trying to tell us is that at some point we will need to grow up. And when we finally do, we will need a proper office like a every traditional business.

The problem is, I'm not sure when the growing up part should start? We've been in business for more than a decade, we have more than 20 full-time staff, we have more than 500,000 users on our platform... at which metrics will we count as a "grown up business"?

[IMAGE of Wordpress Office Space]

We're not alone in this. There are many companies bigger than us that are all-remote and successful. Some of them I'll be referring to in later chapters of this book. Companies like Buffer which is more than twice our size and also fully remote. MySQL at more than 400 people had most of their team working from either remote offices or from their homes. Automattic, the makers of Wordpress had a beautiful office space in the heart of San Francisco (shown above) which they had to shut down because nobody was going there. And they've just crossed a threshold of more than 1000 full-time staff. All of them working completely remotely from virtually all the countries in the world. They're not only responsible for the open-source Wordpress project which runs one third of all Internet sites, but they're also running many successful commercial projects. I would argue that their business is vastly more complicated than mine and they have 30 times the workforce of my team and yet they still get it all done without any central offices.

With all that intro out of the way, why would you want to go #NoOffice? Let's focus on the benefits of remote work in the next chapter.

---
part: intro
title: Why remote work rocks
subtitle: What are the benefits of remote work?
---

## OK, Michael, tell me what do you like so much about running a #NoOffice team?

Why work remotely or encourage your boss or your employees to pick up remote work? Why do people on my team love our all-remote working arrangement?

Well, for a few reasons:

### Less stress and more saved time

Whenever I'm on a way to a conference in a major city and I'm stuck in a traffic jam I'm sitting there in the car and I'm thinking to myself: *"Wow, people have to endure this every day?"*

I don't. I don't usually experience a traffic jam because my home office is in the same building where I live, just upstairs. No traffic jams on the staircase especially after I've sent my three daughters to school.

And how much time is wasted on going to work? If it's a major city it can take up to 1 hour each way! That's 2 hours daily... that's 1/4 of your official 8-hour workday... wasting on what? On moving you to a computer.

That's right. Most of us these days are knowledge workers, we're not factory workers cranking widgets. We are paid to be using our brilliant minds to get stuff done. If that's so, how does it make sense for professionals to be commuting daily from one place to another just to sit in front of the computer? Can't they have computers at home?

Of course it's not that simple but we'll talk in more detail how to set up a perfect working environment for remote workers in their homes later in this book.

### Lifestyle choice - where do you really want to live?

One of my favorite examples was when I hired an assistant, Magda, and at that time she was living in the capital city of Poland, Warsaw. She was used to working in a traditional office so when I hired her she was like: *"So Michael, where do you want me to go to work for you?"*

I responded that she didn't have to go anywhere - all she needed was a laptop to be able to work with me. That's all. At first she felt a little strange and uncomfortable but later she got used to it. So much so in fact, that after only 6 months of working together she asked me for a video call and made this very cool request: *"Michael, I've always wanted to live in France. Now that I work completely remotely, can I move to France and still be a part of our Nozbe team? What do you think?*. There was a pause and I had to ask her this very important question: *"Do they have Internet in France?"*

I assume they do because she moved there and lived for another 2 years in France while still working with me. I didn't care and didn't exactly know where she lived in France but she was happy because she didn't have to sacrifice her lifestyle because of her work. Her job actually supported her new lifestyle.

And we have more stories like this. I remember that at some point in the span of just 6 months we had 7 people moving their main residence to different cities to be closer to their families or loved ones, or just because they could.

### Talent choice - hire the best people for the job!

All this works also for the business owner - you can hire people from anywhere. You're not limited to where they live or where your offices are. Just find the best people for the job!

We have countless stories of really getting fantastic people from very remote cities of Poland and Europe just because they didn't want to move their residency. They had offers from head-hunters but they never took these offers seriously because this would mean moving away - a complete change of lifestyle for them and their families. Being on our team they have an opportunity to be working on a global product and while earning a competitive salary without raising their costs of living and changing their families' world completely by moving away from a place they call their home.

Hiring remote workers is not easy though and we've learned our lessons there. Later in this book I'll be outlining our process of hiring new employees to the team. I'll show you step by step how we find the best people and vet them if they are both intellectual and cultural fit for our team.

### Flexible working hours is a must!

This is something any company should be offering whether they're remote or not. Unfortunately most companies don't. Not only because people can't be effective for 8 hours straight, but also because it's just great to be able to have a break every now and then and work when you're feeling truly productive and motivated.

Especially in winter things can get depressing. In a country on the northern hemisphere like Poland when you wake up and you go to work it's dark. Later when you leave your office it's dark as well. And if you work for a very traditional company, you sit all day in an open office setup with just artificial light.

Wouldn't it be great if you could take a break in the middle of the day when it's sunny outside and just go out for a walk or a jog? Or attend your daughter's recital at school in the middle of the work day and be one of these cool parents who really cares?

Of course it would. Later in the book I'll give you examples of how people work at our company and how vastly different schedules they have... and how we deal with it in order to be on the same page as a team and stay in touch.

### More focused time for your best work!

For me particularly this is the most important argument as a "productivity guy". You get more focused time because you work in your home office. Much fewer interruptions. People don't tap you on the shoulder and ask you things because it's just a more convenient moment for them.

If you want to finish your meaningful work you can basically shut down the Internet and just work. You shut down all the communication channels and there are no push notifications coming to annoy you. You can just work in a completely focused way.

There is this old saying that you don't get anything done in an office after 10 a.m. because everybody shows up and they talk, interrupt each other, come up with meetings...

And as mentioned above, as knowledge workers we need our focused time. After all we're paid to be using our brain. Our job is to create the best contribution we can to the company we're working for and how can we do it if we lack long focused stretches of time?

Later in this book I'll be presenting our concept of the "Pyramid of Communication" where we'll give you practical examples of how to get more of focused work for yourself and for your teammates.

## The culture of an all-remote team is very different from "traditional" teams.

What's different? What's special? Is it all "unicorns and cupcakes"? How does it feel to run a #NoOffice team, really?

### People are cool, when they do cool work

In a #NoOffice culture is that you don't judge people by the way they look or speak, or whether they have a smoke or coffee with you... none of this matters because you're not in the same physical space. What matters is something much more important.

Your co-workers are cool when they deliver quality work.

That's right. The only way to show off in an all-remote environment is to do so by delivering great work. By contributing something really important to the team. You think of others as "cool" when they impress you with their work. That's all that matters.

In a traditional office you can fake work and pass by as "busy", "contributing" and "cool" by wearing fashionable clothes and faking productivity by attending all the meetings and being loud there and asking questions all the time. In a #NoOffice team your work speaks louder than words.

### We are connected through trust and good work

I'll raise the issue of trust many more times in this book. Trust is key to a great and thriving #NoOffice environment.

I've observed that in my team people are more likely to connect and "make friends" with other people who are equally good or better than themselves. Who are really impressing them with amazing work. Who are motivating them to take their skills to a whole new level.

And you can really see that when we meet in person. You can see these friendships there.

### We celebrate our #NoOffice team as we meet in person every half a year at least.

Just because we're an all-remote team, it's not like we completely don't see each other. We meet every half a year for a week. Once in the Spring and once in the Fall. We rent a hotel with a big conference room and we spend time together. We hang out, talk, discuss, eat out, drink, play and much more to recharge our batteries for the months to come. It's a really special time for us.

We call this a "Nozbe Reunion" and we love meeting like this and usually once it's done we look forward to the next one. There's an entire chapter in this book where I explain step by step how we organize our reunions. What works, what doesn't and what is really important to us when we meet in person. How we stay engaged, connected and excited during an intensive week like this. I'll also share examples from other companies doing similar "off-sites".

### We seek opportunities to meet privately, too!

In the previous section I wrote that we meet every half a year "at least" for a reason. In a #NoOffice environment people go out of their way to meet when they can. If someone is traveling to a city where other co-workers live, they contact them beforehand to meet in person for a coffee, beer or lunch. When there's a conference in a city nearby, several co-workers try to get together to go.

Sometimes they stay at each other's places. It's so much fun when all of the sudden we have a virtual meeting and we see two people show up in front of one camera.

Because people don't hang out with each other every day, they're looking forward to being together for a while, but it's really curious how they work then. To be discussed, as always, later in this book how they do it because #NoOffice co-workers really work differently from people used to being in a traditional office.

### We have a better social life because we plan time after work

When people tell me that remote work is for introverts only, I laugh. I'm an extrovert myself and I still prefer #NoOffice work because when I do work, I can focus on my stuff completely and I can get lots done and after work I can plan a social life and have a great one to boot!

I'm an amateur triathlete so I bike a lot, I run and swim. And I play tennis, which has nothing to do with triathlon but I've recently discovered this sport and I love it. And the best part, I get to meet new people and have different friends while doing each of these sports. I have a swimming buddy, and completely different running buddies and biking buddies. This also helps me stay grounded as these people have nothing to do with my work but I get to know them and their lives through the sports. I have a chance of getting out of my own "work bubble" and get to know people who are different then me.

The thing is, when people come back from work they're usually exhausted and want to relax and rest. When I'm done with my work I'm usually excited to spend an afternoon with family and friends. I'm actively planning the time after work because I'm craving more human connection. I get to choose the people I spend time with, unlike in a traditional office where I'm forced to hang out day in and day out with people I wouldn't necessarily like to be around.

Yes, there's another chapter in this book dedicated to this. How to plan your "free time", how to juggle the work-life balance when working from home and how to have a great family life thanks to being a part of a #NoOffice team. There's lots of nuance there and it takes some skill to do it right so make sure to read it up.

As always, it all comes down to this:

> "Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do"

Yes, I'll be repeating this phrase on and on in this book to make sure it sticks.

Now that we've dealt with the basic benefits of being a part of an all-remote team, let's talk about the dark side of the remote work - its overall perception and the lack of control. It'll make a perfect closing chapter for an introduction to the #NoOffice book.

---
part: intro
title: Why you might need an office
subtitle: What are the reasons for businesses to have offices
---

## There's a reason why business have offices, right?

Now let's flip the coin and and ask why you still might need an office? What would you need an office for? What are the common reasons for businesses to rent office space? Apart from the default notion that "every business needs an office"...

### You want to show off and prove you're serious

Banks want to prove their credibility by having enormous office spaces in the centers of the cities. Many businesses replicate this behavior and are striving for the most top-tier office space to be able to put up a big sign with their logo on top of a glass building on the Main Street.

This giant sign on a wall of an office is a clear indication that the business is serious.

Actually the whole thing about putting signs on things reminds me of this great scene from the 2009 movie "Up In The Air" with George Clooney who plays Ryan and Anna Kendrick who plays Nathalie when she asks him what would happen if he hit his dream target of 10,000,000 miles:

```
Natalie: Do they throw you a parade?
Ryan: You get lifetime executive status. You get to meet the chief pilot, Maynard Finch. (..) And they put your name on the side of a plane.
Natalie: Men get such hardons from putting their names on things. You guys don't grow up. It's like you need to pee on everything.
```

In tech companies there are additional ways to show you're cool and you have a great working environment. Like open space offices which in theory inspire creativity - something I'll be addressing later in this book. Like ping pong and foosball tables which in theory inspire team spirit.

I get it. You want your office to be cool. I feel the same way. My "home office" is cool. I dedicate my office space so much time that I actually re-design it every year. More on that later.

### Your customers need to visit you

As our customers are from all over the world, they're not very likely to visit us. Like at all. Our office is our web site and we spend lots of time on making sure it's great, up-to-date and with links to all the places you can get our apps from. We edit it constantly, especially our blog with lots of useful and helpful productivity-focused information. We have a dedicated team responsible for our documentation, too. That's our virtual office and that's where our customer visit us.

But I understand that many companies do need an office to be able to host their customers. However, even then you need to really know how often these customers will really come to see you. Does it make sense to have a big conference room when you have somebody over about once a month on average? And because they don't visit you that often, maybe your conference room is actually not spanking clean but turned into a filing cabinet? Again, if you look at an office as a tool to get a job done, there are better ways of having a space to host your customers and dazzle them in the process - and we'll discuss examples later in this book.

### You need to get "real work" done and "real meetings"

This is one of my favorite arguments. Take a look at two photos below - one of them depicts my team discussing something together in the same physical space and the other one shows them in a virtual video conference room. Somehow the picture with the physical space indicates "real work" and  the other one not so much. When you meet with someone, do you need their "body"? Their physical presence? Or do you need their "mind"? How come the virtual room is so different than the physical room?

IMAGE of both rooms

Many people keep telling me this: *"We need a proper office space for meetings. We have so many cool ideas and they wouldn't work if we were not in the same space. We are brainstorming a lot!"*

Well, you know what? We also have lots of ideas! Too many in fact. We can't keep up shipping new versions of Nozbe - we already have ideas for our app 2 years in advance! And we do have meetings. And our meetings are great when they happen.

And one more thing:

> if you're spending too many hours brainstorming stuff together, you're doing it wrong!

There are whole chapters in this book dedicated to meetings, brainstorming, giving feedback and all that. Heck, there's even an entire section dedicated to getting communication done in a team. And physical space has nothing to do with its efficacy.

Actually, it's the contrary - being in one office is conducive to doing too many meetings: *"we're all here anyway, so let's do a meeting!"* And "more meetings by default" is not a key to better team collaboration. It's all about the process, the structure and not wasting people's time. Keep reading.

## Does it matter where you are, or how you work?

Now that we've talked a little more about the need of an office or lack thereof, let me give you a glimpse of how it's been leading an all-remote team for more than a decade now in the next chapter.

---
part: intro
title: The dark side of remote work
subtitle: Perception and control - main problems with remote work?
---

## It's not all "cupcakes and rainbows" here

Running and being a part of an all-remote team has its drawbacks, too. Especially when it comes down to how we're perceived by the "real world".

## We might seem "unprofessional" to the outside world

The other side of the "social coin" is that we might not seem very "professional" to the people around us. Especially to our real-world friends. After all, they "go to work" every day and we "stay at home", so what is it that we're actually doing again?

On top of that, because of the flexibility of our work both in time and space, I get to drive the kids to school and usually pick them up as well. I'm there for their recitals and for the parents' meetings. Seems I'm a stay-at-home dad. Which I am, but with work that nobody in my community really sees.

I remember my first home office when I launched Nozbe. It was an IKEA desk/cabinet in a corner of the living room of my first one-bedroom apartment. One day my mum called me and asked what was that I was actually doing, because when her friends' sons where becoming "senior managers" or "directors" in "important companies", I was this guy sitting at home all day.

I said: *"Mum, I'm a CEO of a global company"* for her to feel better about me, but I don't think she was convinced.

My wife is a lawyer and she works in a big local office. I also remember meeting a colleague of hers on our kids' party one day and she asked me bluntly: *"Michael, do you actually work?"* I had to really swallow my ego on that one.

Yep, there's a whole chapter on that, too. The drawbacks of working from home, the perception of the outside world thinking you're just this lazy stay-at-home person... and how to deal with that and make sure you stay sane.

## Major problem: there's no control!

Now that we've turned to the disadvantages of working in a #NoOffice environment let's tackle the main problem had-on. How to control people when they work from their homes?

> There's the old saying that **"trust is good but control is better".** but I'd argue that the #NoOffice version of it is **"control is good but trust is better"**

Trust is the key to any relationship. Especially to professional relationships in a #NoOffice team. We don't install keyloggers on people's computers, webcams in their homes or do any of that creepy stuff. We trust that people who work with us do their work in the 40-hour week that we have agreed upon. And it's up to them to track it and deliver the results.

When I explain this, people think I'm a sucker. Yet they believe they control their team when they have them in the same physical space. How can they be sure that John isn't spending too much time going out for a smoke with Steve and Jane? How can they know for a fact that when Judy is in front of her computer, she's really working hard instead of browsing Facebook? They can't and they don't. They think the "management by walking around" is enough of a motivation for people to work effectively.

> At the end of the day do you want to work with people that you trust or do you want to work with people that you have to control?

## How do you trust your lawyers and accountants?

When people ask me about trusting remote workers, I ask them about their finances and legal situation. I ask how important these both issues are for them. Well, they almost always respond that both are big deal for them. If so, then how come these both issues are usually outsourced to accountants and lawyers who are not in the same office, maybe even the same city?

Yes, that's right. You're probably working with remote workers right now without thinking too much about it. You're working with your lawyers and accountants and sharing very crucial information with them. You trust them... but you don't trust your own employees?

subtitle: Why I've written this book and who it's for.

## Hey, Michael, are you trying to convince me to drop my office with this book?

I'm not telling you to do anything. I'm just trying to point out that an office should be perceived as an additional tool for you to help you get stuff done. When you look at your office this way, you might re-think its purpose and the way you're using it right now. And most importantly you'll re-think the way you work!

### This book is not about getting rid of office space but about working more effectively in a team, whether you have an office or not.

This book is about taking your team's productivity to a whole new level and showing you that the office space is not a requirement to do that. Taking our company and other #NoOffice companies as an example, my goal is to uncover the best practices for the team to communicate and get stuff done better. Even if not everyone is in the same physical space.

Ultimately remember that:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

## This book's goal is to change your mindset

After all, it's 2018. We have all this amazing technology and the iPhone in my pocket is more powerful than most laptops a few years ago. Yet with most people's mindset we're still stuck in thinking that we need an office to do business. That without an office there's no business. And that remote work is only for unicorns.

> With this book let's try to design the most effective way to work and communicate in a team during these modern times.

So let's start with the key to team's success - internal communication - in the next part of this book.
