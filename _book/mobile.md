## The trouble with reliance on office... the documents!

When decisions not made in the office?

How can you send stuff to people?

## Old school work

You have paper documents, you scan them, you send them via email.

## Modern #NoOffice companies are doing it better



### Go paperless and mobile

- Papers are so... XX century

- Scan everything that’s coming in

- Use Scanbot or Evernote or other app that helps you scan things quickly and has an OCR

- Attach documents to tasks in Nozbe Teams

- Upload stuff to Dropbox Folder

- Be able to link (and comment on things) at all times

- Use Google Suite for spreadsheets

- Use Dropbox Paper for documentation

- Work on stuff collaboratively always

- Use only apps that support mobile viewing and editing

- Remember about security

	- Use restrictions to your team

	- Use VPN

- Case study - how we use GitHub not only for code, but also for writing texts together

	- And how I can use both the iPad and the iPhone to do it!

- One thing:

	- Make sure everything can be accessed via a link and via any device from anywhere - test but make sure you’ve got security in place

	- Further reading?
