Modern offices are were all the magic happens. Where all the work is done in the most efficient way possible, right?

Wrong. Not really.

Over many years of talking to other businesses and improving our work in Nozbe's all-remote team, we've identified three major problems with current offices and with the way teamwork is done in them.

## Three sins of modern offices

1. **Bad habits** - office space is conducive to creating bad habits in the team, like "brainstorming sessions", or "in-promptu meetings".
2. **Open workspace** - most office spaces are very "open", so people working there have trouble finding any kinds of focus. There are just too many audio and visual distractions all the time!
3. **It's all in the office, only!** - the physical space of an office creates this artificial limit of work and forces the organization to depend on the office (papers, documents, meetings, whiteboards...). This makes doing work much harder or virtually impossible outside of it.

In this section of the book I'll be tackling all these problems and much more. I'll try to show you how one one hand, the office which you currently have can be used much better for the work that you do, and on the other, how you can make that work less dependable on the physical constraints of an office. Ultimately, "work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do".

## The office does not business make

A business doesn't exist because of the office... but because of a need to do something. To provide additional value. To create a good venue to do great work.

That’s why it's time to start questioning why you really might need an office, and if so, how should it look like or work to give you the best results?

If anything, the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown us all, that much of the work, especially for knowledge workers, can be done outside of the office as successfully as in the office, if not more!

So before you dive into this section of the book, ask yourself these questions:

- Does “having an office” make you a better company?
- Does it help you get things done better?
- Does it improve the quality of your team members’ lives?
- Does it make your team more efficient?
- Does it enable you to get the best talent you can afford?
- What's the real purpose of your office?
- How can you make it better?

Let's answer these questions in next chapters.
