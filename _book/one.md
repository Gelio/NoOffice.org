- It doesn’t matter if you have an office or not, most of the companies don’t work very efficiently

- As a productivity company with 500K+ users and around 100K teams using Nozbe, we’ve learned a lot about team productivity

- These are the best team productivity tips that worked for us

Let's repeat again:

A business doesn't exist because of the office... but because of a need to do something. To provide value. To do the work.

That’s why  I encourage you to question why you really need that office. Does “having an office” make you a better company? Helps you get things done better? Improves quality of your team members’ lives? Helps you be more efficient? Helps you get the best talent you can afford?
