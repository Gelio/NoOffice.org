## Traditional office is not as secure as you might think!

There are various approaches to securing team's data and systems. Old-school approach is insisting on having a physical office just for the sake of security. One could argue that only then real tangible control over everything can be implemented. Now that we have all of our devices connected to the Internet, the data we store on our devices is exposed beyond the constraints of the office buildings. Some companies try to restrict access by having extra firewalls and constraints imposed by the network systems within the office. That's great, but it's not sustainable because if an employee would leave the building, they would instantly lose access to many (if not all) company mandated services and systems. What the Coronavirus pandemic taught us in 2020 is that having access to work environment outside of the realm of an office is not just convenience. It's a must.

Luckily, there are ways of keeping it secure. This chapter will serve as a handy security checklist for all the teams large and small that want to set up their work environment on the Internet in a safe way. It's based on our years of experience, consultation with many other similar companies and just following and improving the best practices in the IT industry. Initially this chapter was a checklist in our internal documentation written up by our VP of Product, Rafał.[^1]

Some of the things written up here I already mentioned in Chapter 19 about going paperless and embracing the cloud but here I'll dive much deeper into security implications of using Internet services.

## Virtual office must be secured even more than a physical one!

When you have a physical traditional office, criminals can still break in, but they'll have to first travel there and then figure out a way of unlocking the locks or turning off an alarm.

The virtual office is much trickier. The Internet lets people *travel* to your office in milliseconds. There are many known ways of hacking into computer systems and your overall security depends on each and everyone on the team. So your systems are as secure as the least secure link or person in it. That's why it's critical to review your security policies on a regular basis, preferably while doing your quarterly review (see Chapter 16) or when having a one-on-one catch up call (see Chapter 24).

### 1. Passwords must be long and unique

It's time to stop using passwords you can remember for all of your services. No more *Test1234* or *Mike1979* or anything like that. Yes, these passwords comply with the usual rule of minimum 8 characters, a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters with numbers. But they're not secure. They're easy to guess.

We use a Password vault app[^2] that everyone on our has to use. This app needs to work on all devices we use for work. For each service our team members need to generate a unique and long password (minimum 12 characters, preferably 20). We've got several vaults configured:

* Private vault - for everyone's own private passwords - our company has no access to it
* Shared vault - shared with all team members
* Marketing vault - for all marketing services we use
* Dev vault - for all engineering-related stuff
* Directors vault - for all mission-critical services

With this set up everyone on the team has access to the *Shared* vault but then selected people depending on their role with the company get access to additional vaults.

The only thing someone has to remember is the password to the Password Vault. It's called the *master password*. The best way to make it really secure it to just glue together four random words and maybe a number. Like: *CarFlowerBiteMust38*. It's easy to remember yet it's nearly impossible for anyone or any system to brute-force figure out.

### 2. Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA or MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)[^3] adds an additional layer of security to online services. It was first used in online banking but now it's a good practice of setting it up everywhere you can. What it means is that to log in to an online service you need not only a combination of your user name and password but also a one-time code generated by your personal device - usually a smartphone[^4].

In our company we use many online services daily and our team members need to set up 2FA for all of them - we have a checklist that we keep maintained and updated[^5].

While you're setting up 2FA for all the services and social media sites you're accessing frequently, make sure to review all their corresponding security options, especially:

* update your password for a stronger one
* add your phone number as an additional means of accessing the account
* review all the connected services or apps that might have access to your account

### 3. Secure your personal devices

In the past people used to get all their devices from their employer - the computer and phone set up and configured by the corporate IT department. However with the recent emergence of smartphones and tablets the *bring your own device*[^6] trend revisited these policies. In our company people use the computers, smartphones and tablets they own themselves. We don't have control over them. So what we do is we have to make sure people secure their devices themselves. For that, we have prepared handy checklists:

* Securing a Mac computer[^7]
* Securing a Windows computer[^8]
* Securing an iPhone or iPad[^9]
* Securing an Android phone[^10]

We make sure our team members review these checklists when they're setting up a new device.[^11] We send these checklists to our family members as well. Security of our devices is just a very good practice.
