### Meet your customers regularly

- Similar to the way we chat with team members

- Choose customers to talk to

	- We choose business customers

	- We see interesting ones (industries)

	- Some people we really want to meet

- Mastermind groups, meet with your peers (peer mentoring)

- Set up calendar slots

	- I use calendly app

	- Have slots reserved for talking to people

	- This way I reconnect and chat

- I have a template

	- I ask how they found Nozbe

	- post the whole template

- I’m curious about their business

	- How they work

	- What specifically they do

	- What they’re passionate about

	- See where I can help them improve

- Zoom etiquette

- I email like texting

	- You can email me at michael@nozbe.com

	- I respond very shortly but I do respond

	- Not every day, but at least once a week

	- We don’t use email internally

- We do webinars

	- We used to do them more often

	- Not to sell anything, just to talk about issues and stuff

- I do vlogs

	- So that they have access to CEO and see what I’m all about

	- I don’t mind being perceived “unprofessional” - if they get value, than it’s great!

	- Quick vlog - I record it on iPad with my microphone

	- I edit in Luma Fusion app on the same iPad

	- Send it to YouTube for my team feedback

	- Do final touches and ship it!

	- Also send it as podcast

- Meeting in person

	- When you’re traveling, schedule time to meet with customers

	- Office rented with on-demand conference room

		- Lawyers

- This way we’re closer to customers than ever

- One thing:

	- Meet customers and talk to them - again, to keep it real - use your lack of offices as an advantage and excuse to get in touch.
