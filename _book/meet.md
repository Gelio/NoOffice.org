## Invite people over to your virtual office!

Just like in the previous chapter about connecting with team members, I think it's critical to regularly meet with customers. I do it all the time. Every week I have a few meetings with Nozbe users.

I know. It totally doesn't scale.

We have more than 700,000 Nozbe users and tens of thousands of paying customers. How can I meet them all? I don't even try to. The goal is not to meet all of them. After all, only Chuck Norris could do that. The idea is to just keep meeting with some of them.

### How I choose customers I meet with?

It all depends. Sometimes someone contacts me via social media or email and I feel we should talk, so I invite them over. Usually however it's my customer support team that does the introductions. When they're corresponding with someone interesting, they casually ask them if they'd be interested having a chat with the CEO. They're usually surprised I'm doing it at all and that the boss himself is available for a direct one-on-one chat with one of the thousands of customers.

### I'm curious about our customers' businesses!

We are lucky that our apps are being used not only by consumers but also by people leading businesses across many sectors and industries. That's why our customer support reps tend to ask for a chat with me if someone is in an industry that we know very little about. I'm a very curious person and I like to learn about the world outside of big tech. This way I get to talk to people who are running insurance companies, real-estate agencies, manufacturing plants, design studios, marketing agencies, law firms or even builders of custom-made motor homes.

Thanks to these chats not only I get to learn how they discovered Nozbe and how they're using it, but most of all, I can broaden my horizons and see that there's a world out there of businesses I've never heard of making some truly amazing stuff.

### I can have a meeting with anyone in the world!

No, I don't have a physical office, but I'm using that as an advantage. I get to have a virtual coffee with a customer from the other side of the world without having them to fly over to me or me visiting them. Of course meeting in person would be even more meaningful, but trust me, just the fact that as the CEO of a company I schedule time to meet individually with some of my customers is meaningful enough!

## How to schedule meetings with customers effortlessly

Now that I explained why meeting *virtually in person* is a great idea, let's get down to the logistics of scheduling such a meeting with everyone in the easiest way possible.

### Use a scheduling app

I use a dedicated scheduling app[^1] and have decided on a few slots per week when I'm available. Usually this is around 4pm Central European Time on a Tuesday and Thursday. This is a very convenient time for me as it's toward the end of my workday and it suits very well my European customers and it's also the beginning of a workday for my American ones (it's 10am New York time). For customers in California I'm usually making an exception and meeting them when it's evening here.

Thanks to using a dedicated app, I just send them a link and they can choose a time that suits them. There's no unnecessary back and forth and trying to agree on a time. They just choose a 30-minute slot available and that's it. Literally a one-click-meeting agreement.

This app is further synchronized with my team's Google Calendar so everyone on my team can see the appointment in the calendar and is aware of my commitment. Very often based on these calendar entries someone is sending me suggestions for questions or topics I can discuss on these meetings.

### Set up a dedicated room for virtual meetings

In my company we're using a video conferencing software[^2] where we can have dedicated rooms for different meetings. The same applies to our customers. We set up a "Nozbe Interviews" meeting room and we send the link to each customer who wants to talk to me. Moreover, they receive the link to this room in their meeting confirmation email.

It's the same link for everyone as I've set up the room this way that a customer must request to join a room. This way when one half-hour meeting is finishing and I see another customer in the waiting room, I can politely steer towards finishing the current conversation and once done, I'm able to let another customer in.

### Have a conversation template to make a meeting meaningful

I still remember from my days of running Productive! Magazine[^3] and interviewing thought leaders for the cover of each issue. Contrary to a popular belief, it can be sometimes very difficult to strike out a great conversation with a very smart person. Usually they are great and we hit it off very quickly, but sometimes they're not in the mood or just not talkative and you need to have a plan of what you're going to ask them to get them to talk to you. That's why for each of my customer interviews we have a template.

Don't worry, I'm not a robot and I don't stick to the template 100% but it serves me as a guideline of what I'm supposed to talk about and what I should ask my customer. This template also reminds me to ask some really good questions and make the meeting more about them and their needs rather than just talk about my app and myself. Here's a series of questions I have prepared usually:

- *What's their company about and what do they do?* - I start about them. After the initial question I ask more follow up questions to really try to understand their basics of their business and get to know better where they're coming from.
- *How they discovered Nozbe?* - Only after I've discovered little about them I ask about my app and its role in their company. I want to know who started using it first, if everyone on the team is using it and how hard or easy it was to get everyone on board.
- *What problem Nozbe is solving for them?* - Now I'm asking again about them and about the problems my app is solving for them. What they're hiring Nozbe to do. If it's just task management, or internal communication, or flow of documents, or all of the above, or maybe something else?
- *Any issues they encounter using Nozbe?* - Now I'm trying to be helpful. I want to understand if they have any difficulties running our software. Maybe some feature they don't like? Maybe they can't do something? Very often here I'm trying to work with them to figure out how to improve the way they use our app. What happens here is that most likely there's an advanced feature in our software they're not aware of and I walk them through how to improve it.
- *Are there any other pieces of software they're using day-to-day apart form Nozbe?* - Now it's time to see if there might be some synergies. Maybe they're using additional tools that can work together with our app. Maybe I can help them improve a workflow. I'm just trying to use my tech expertise to help them out beyond just my app.
- *Anything else I can help you with?* - At the end of the conversation I ask for additional questions or any other things they'd like to know. Maybe they're curious about how we run our company (now I'll finally be able to refer them to this book!) or anything else I've been recently writing about on our Nozbe blog or my personal blog[^4].

### Get personal if possible. It's all about a human connection!

Thanks to these questions I can be as helpful as possible. But not only that. With such a conversation I can quickly see how much we *click* as people. After all this is not only a business relationship. It's just two people talking about things.

That's why depending on how the conversation goes, I'm getting more personal if the customer lets me. We sometimes later talk about our passions, our struggles, our hobbies and other things we care about. Very often I get asked about how I get all of my work done on an iPad[^5] or if I'm going to get the latest iPhone and what I think about it.

That's the beauty of meeting the customers one-on-one. Not only do I get to learn so much about people who're using my software but most importantly I get to learn about different industries and build relationships with very interesting people from all over the world!

In these conversations I'm also using my additional super powers. I'm a polyglot. I speak fluently not only my mother tongue (Polish) but also English (duh!), Spanish and German. This way I get extra points for surprising my customers when I start talking to them in their language.
