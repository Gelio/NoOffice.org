## Forget acronyms, go with a decision-making process

Let's enhance the previous chapter about the "Pyramid of Communication" and get very practical. Below you won't find any smart (or S.M.A.R.T.) acronyms, but a pretty straightforward decision-making process that we follow in my team. It is largely inspired by everything mentioned in the previous chapters of this book. I'll explain the process first and later I'll follow along with two real-world examples to illustrate my point.

## People should be empowered to make small decisions

Micromanagement is a thing of the past. At least it should be in all modern teams. After all, each team member is an expert in their field and whenever they see something they can change or improve, they should just go with their gut and do it.

They should follow this simple rule:

> Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness!

Small decisions have small consequences so even if people make a mistake or two while deciding on their own, these are usually easy fixes. I always explain our new hires, that they won't be fired for making mistakes, they'll be fired for not moving forward fast enough, for not shipping things, for not delivering value.

## Bigger decisions should be done deliberately

By "bigger decisions" I mean things that require involvement of more people. Either by participating in the process of deciding, or being impacted by the decision. Such decisions shouldn't be made on a whim, but on the other hand, a modern team cannot lose too much time waiting until someone finally decides one way or the other. For this, we have a process which was in parts outlined in the previous chapters of this book, but let me recap it for you here.

## Just follow a simple 5-step decision-making process

What it comes down to is five easy steps: first you identify the problem you're trying to solve, then you take your time to think, research and come up with a solution. Next you write it up for yourself and others on the team. After that you discuss it on your next weekly meeting and then you either revise it or just move to implementation.

Pretty easy, right? Let me break it down for you with an example. Here's how we implement a new feature in our app:

### Step 1. Identify the problem.

After talking to some customers and listening to their stories I realized they needed a particular problem solved in our Nozbe Teams app.

Instead of writing to our VP of Product: *"Hey, we need this feature in Nozbe Teams!"*, I'm doing something different. I'm creating a task with this problem in our "Nozbe Teams Design" project and I'm scheduling a few hours the next day to think about it and come up with a solution.

Very rarely (as in: never) there are features that need to be implemented ASAP. Even if there's a common problem that many customers are facing, I know that I can take a few days to think about it well, before we will solve it. They customers will survive and they'll thank me later for really thinking it through.

### Step 2. Research and come up with a solution.

Now it's time to do some research. I'd ordinarily do a mix of the following things:

- check in past tasks and documents if we haven't already tried to approach this problem before
- read on the Internet how other companies are dealing with similar situations
- get some books or articles on the subject
- watch a bunch of helpful videos on YouTube about it
- also I'd ask some team mates by mentioning them in the comment to my task

It's important to take the time to do proper research. I give myself at least 2 hours to do the initial study. And based on my gut, I then decide how much more time I need for this.

### Step 3. Write it up for myself and everyone else.

Now it's time to write it up. As I know that the next "design meeting" is on Tuesday, by Monday evening I'm writing up a proposed solution to the problem. Once I'm done, I'm updating the task and moving it to our "next meeting agenda" section to show everyone that I want my topic to be discussed on the next meeting.

I'm doing my write up in such a way that people can post their comments on Tuesday morning ahead of the meeting. This way the discussions are happening before we even met and many issues can be addressed early.

### Step 4. Discuss the solution on a meeting.

Once the meeting has started, everyone in the room (or "virtual room" in our case) has already learned about my problem, read the solution and usually also posted their initial reactions in the comments.

That's why I don't spend time presenting the solution, but we dive right into the nuances and issues with my idea. In Chapter 8 I already explained how we talk, discuss, argue and fight on our meetings. And how we eventually reach a conclusion.

### Step 5. Make the decision.

With this whole process the goal is to reach one of three outcomes:

- move to implementation of the proposed solution
- take one more week to review the feedback and discuss the revised solution in a week
- or completely discard the solution (and make a task for the future to approach the problem differently)

That's it. The decision comes down to these three options. Sometimes the solution is really straightforward and after just a little debate, it goes to implementation unchanged or with a few tweaks here and there. Another time we just need one more week. There's lots of feedback, the person proposing the solution must digest it, incorporate it and present a revised solution the following week. However, there are times when we decided the problem identified is not really that big of a deal, or that the solution that we came up with is not something we'd be proud of... or it's just too early for this. And we discard it entirely for now.

## Why take a few days to make a decision?

As a team with a strong bias towards action, it's sometimes hard for us to just wait for the next weekly meeting to discuss a solution. We're a small, agile, nimble and smart team after all, right? Let's just do it!

Not so fast.

What we've found out is that in most decision, taking a few days to review it, analyze it and ask for feedback is not really a big deal and it makes a decision much better.

> Go with your gut with small decisions, but take a few days for bigger ones.

This is when having regular and optional weekly meetings makes so much sense (as discussed in Chapter 7). Instead of deciding on something today, I know I can take a few moments to analyze this, think more, write it up and discuss on the next week's meeting. The decision will be delayed by a few days but it's going to be a better one as I'll have the time to digest it properly and receive feedback from smart people around me.

Very often these few days make all the difference. You have the time to see additional context and gather more information. On the other hand, it's a week tops. So it's not like you're dwelling on the decision for too long and reaching a so-called analysis paralysis[^1].

## How to implement a decision in a smarter way

OK, let's say you've gone through all the 5 steps of this decision-making process and yet you're still unsure. You're *almost ready* to run with a decision but you have still some doubts. Maybe it's not? Maybe it's too early? Maybe there's a better way? Luckily we have a few tricks up our sleeve that we've successfully used in such situations to help us move forward.

### "Cheapo" way is the best way

The definition of "cheap" in a dictionary stands for *inexpensive and of poor quality* which is exactly what we're aiming for here. If we're not sure about a decision but we want to try to see how it *feels* what we do is we figure out the "cheapest way" to get it done. Without much overhead, with minimum design... we just implement it and live with the decision like this. When we already like the decision done in a "cheapo" way, we then move forward with fully-blown implementation.

In our products, we very often just add a feature without announcing it to the customers. We observe if we notice it at all, if they use it, if they report back to us how much they like it but how they feel it could be improved.

### Limit the impact to just few people

When we're unsure about a decision, we just limit how many people it affects. In our products, especially in Nozbe Teams, we just release a new feature to our team only. We call it "Dogfooding"[^2].

When we're introducing a new policy in our company, we very often first limit it to just a few people or a department first, and see its impact. We then take feedback and only later roll it out in the entire team.

This practice is very common in marketing activities. Savvy marketers first try out an ad on a smaller target group and measure its impact. After initial tests they roll out the ad on larger groups of prospects.

### Set a date to review, because decisions are not set in stone

We assume that each decision is temporary. Very often after committing to a decision, we set a date for a "revision meeting" set 2 or 3 months in the future, to review the decision.

On such meeting we analyze what went "OK", what was "not OK" and what needs improvement. We usually do it through a virtual video conference meeting, where the host of the meeting shares a screen with a mind map of all these points visible to everyone. They update the mind map as feedback comes. After such a meeting the host writes up their conclusions and suggestion for the future.

## One thing: take just enough time to make a decision!

Itâ€™s a good idea to take a little time to make a bigger decision because we as humans tend to take too many rushed decisions. Just follow the 5-step process outlined above and don't be afraid to implement something in a *cheapo* way.

Parts of our process are inspired by Ryan Singer's "Shape Up" book[^3] so I recommend you read it, too.
