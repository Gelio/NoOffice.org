### Make decisions deliberately

- How we decide on things

- We first write a proposal

- People comment on it asynchronously

- We add it to the agenda of our next meeting - the decision has the time to mature

- We discuss issues with the proposal or reject it or question it

- Responsible person re-writes it and it’s added to the next available agenda

- If the decision to implement / do something is temporary, we set up a task in the future for that person to revisit it or schedule a “lessons learned” session

- Lessons learned using OK, NOT OK, IMPROVE

	- New proposal

	- It gets approved again and goes through the same process

- Customer support QS story

	- Email from customer

	- Short conversation with Iwona

	- Proposal for a meeting

	- Decisión to run the meeting

	- We ran the meeting for 8 sessions

	- Lessons learned session scheduled

	- Improvements made

		- Agenda earlier

		- Every two weeks instead of one week

- One thing

	- It’s a good idea for a decision to take time - we tend to take too many rushed decisions

	- Further reading?


Additional notes from previous chapters:


- Shape up - fall in love with the problem - not solution

- Design Fight

	- Only 5 people are part of the group

		- People chosen deliberately

		- When a new person wants to join - with their proposal - only they can join

		- We speak freely, sometimes we really fight and get angry

		- That’s OK

	- We follow process

		- Proposals for Monday evening

			- Written according to Shape up template

		- Topics written up as tasks in Nozbe Teams

			- Section in Nozbe Design project

			- Design channel on Slack

			- All transparent, we welcome feedback from entire team

		- Asynchronous Tuesday comments
