### Write stuff down at all times!

- Don’t keep things in your mind - it’s a bad place to store information

- Mind is playing tricks on you

- I have too much on my mind, my plate - you’re doing it wrong

- That’s why the first productivity principle is to write things down in your system

- Calendar, post it notes, notepad...

- Or a digital system, task manager, note-taking app, calendar app

- We forget what people said, what they wanted - so when we chat about stuff and don’t write things down right then, things fall through the cracks

- The culture of your team has to change - to write things down

- Create a task for me!

- It’s in this or that place

	- Make sure you’ve got guidelines

	- So people on your team know where to look for stuff when you’re not around

	- Post signs - before you talk to me - check if it’s in our system

- Comment on stuff - in documents, tasks, notes...

- Meeting minutes - not optional - obligatory after each meeting - clear who’s doing them

- How we’re doing it

	- We do chat on Slack

	- We put actionable stuff - projects and tasks in Nozbe Teams

	- We write documentation on Dropbox Paper

	- We put files in Dropbox Team folder

	- We migrate permanent documentation to our internal Nozbe.team site

- One thing

	- Make sure your team gets the culture of writing stuff down

	- If it’s written down, it can be linked to, referred to, it can be found. And accessed by anyone on the team, from anywhere.
