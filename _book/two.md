## Let's get rid of the office and keep working... better!

Almost every business owner on the planet was forced to treat office as an "optional" thing in the months of March-April 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

I deliberately chose to dedicate the first half of this book to *making office work better* and now as we reach the second half, I want to show you how all this can be done without a physical office.

When an office is just a tool that you may or may not choose to use.

## There is no office, thereâ€™s only work

Let's get back to the premise of this book:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do!

Ultimately if you have an office or not, if people go there every day or not, it's all up to you or your boss or your team's situation. Because the office is not the goal.

The goal is to do great work.

Or to quote a former president of the USA, Thomas Jefferson in the *Hamilton* musical:[^1]

> "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We fought for these ideals, we shouldn't settle for less!"

So let's not settle for working in an office like we *always used to* but let's re-imagine work. Let's see if we can achieve more personal and organizational happiness by giving people a better life at work and much more liberty.

## Time for part 2 of #NoOffice - the practical guide to remote work

In the following chapters I'll expand on the ideas of a modern workplace which I outlined in part 1.

It's all practical and based on our experience of running Nozbe, an all-remote company, for the last 13 years, as well as examples of other remote-first companies much larger than ours.

Let's leave the office out and just focus on work.

However, if we want to do that, we need to address the elephant in the room and openly address the issue of trust in workplace in the next chapter.
