## People who live close to you might not be any good!

Most *traditional companies* hire people based on their geographical proximity to the office. It sounds ridiculous that the ultimate decision about a hire is done by the office building itself. The building decides. I mean, not literally but if the office is too far, a candidate wouldn't apply or you wouldn't even consider a person for the job.

This basically means that when looking for a team member the deciding factor is geography, not competence. Which is in sane, but there we are, when we're confined to working in a physical office space.

Even the supposedly smartest people on the planet think this way. I remember that in early days of Nozbe I was considering additional funding through one of the Silicon Valley Venture Capital firms. I gave up quickly as I realized that they wanted me to move my Nozbe Headquarters to where they resided. Within max 20 mile radius of their offices. Before they even wanted to talk to me about the actual Nozbe product they would invest in, they needed first to know if I'm willing to move.

It didn't matter that such a decision would complicate everything for me and my team, cost lots of money and administrative headaches and contribute nothing to the development of the product as such. Geography mattered. So I gave up and in the end I never took a VC investment and kept the company bootstrapped, funded entirely from the payments by our customers. We're doing fine, thanks for asking.

The benefit of a "No Office" mindset is that you have a chance to get the exact person for the job that you need. And they can be living very far away from you, yet be a perfect fit with the team and be delivering the exact kind of work that you need. So don't get held up by geography and expand your horizons. Hire from anywhere in the world.

## How to get the best person for the job, from anywhere in the world.

There's a very popular saying in HR: *hire slow, fire fast*. There's some truth in this statement. You should take your time to hire a person, especially if you're doing it completely remotely. Over the years we've gone through several iterations of our hiring process and the following is what works for us at Nozbe:

### Step 1. Great job description.

The job description is the key to getting a great hire. It's basically a sales letter - you want to sell the job to a perfect candidate[^1]. It should include these three key things:

* **Description of the work environment.** An answer to the big fat *WHY?* as in *Why should I even consider working for you?*. We briefly describe that we're an all-remote company, which perks we offer, what's the size of the team and where you would fit, what we believe in, how we work, what kind of perks we offer. The goal is that a person who doesn't even know our company can quickly decide if that's a place they'll see themselves work for.
* **Description of the position.** Here we list the minimum required skills for the job. We also expand it with a list of additional *nice-to-haves*. Later we explain deeper what this job really means for us. What the person would actually work on if they were hired. The key is to give the candidate a good idea of not only what we want but also why we want it and why it's important to us. And how much they'd be earning.
* **Outline of the recruitment process and the next steps.** Here we explain how to apply and also how the rest of the application process will look like. It's important to set expectations correctly for both the candidate and the team.

### Step 2. CV and cover letter.

To make sure we get quality candidates for a position, we require them to send in their most updated CV via email with a short message explaining why we should consider them for the position. No need for a formal cover letter but a personalized email message would be appreciated.

This is where many candidates lose points. Most just send a short email saying: "Here's my CV for the position, Best regards". That's it.

They don't understand that to us, it's already strike one. They could have taken 5 minutes to browse our site, read a little more about the company, and explained why we should choose them instead of someone else. Most don't bother to do it. They don't understand that the content of this email is being read by someone and is being judged as well. This is the place where they can potentially stand out.

### Step 3. Written interview through an online form.

We reply to the initial email with CV quickly with a short thank you note and we ask them to fill out an online form for us[^2].

This online form is very important as it gives us a chance to interview a candidate before we even talk to them. We can ask very specific questions and hopefully get good answers that will tell us a lot about the candidate.

As all is done in writing, we don't know how the person looks like or sounds. This helps also eliminate any kind of personal bias that's irrelevant when it comes to the job. That's why the quality of the questions we give them in the form is extremely important as the answers give us an initial feel for the person.

We communicate the final date of receiving applications to each candidate and we explain to them that only once we've got it all - the CV, the cover letter and the form filled out, we'll start going through the applications.

### Step 4. First video interview with the team.

Once we've gone through all the applications we try to eliminate as many as possible and choose the top 5 candidates. Depending on the job position we might be receiving tens if not more applications. That's why everything matters. And we like to hire good writers.

Up until now we haven't seen the person, so we're judging everything. Their cover letter or lack thereof. How quickly they answer to email and how well they write. Regardless of the position, when working remotely, the written word is key. As explained in the previous chapters of this book, we write a lot to each other. In tasks, in comments, in documents before the meetings, in chatâ€¦ we write everywhere. That's why we try to choose the best writers.

Once we've chosen our top 5, their team leader schedules the interviews. Usually we get two people involved in an interview. The team leader and a peer who'd be potentially working with the candidate. This way they both can look at a person from two different points of view.

As you can see, such process is very taxing. With only five interviews done by two people from the team each time, at least 10 man-hours are being spent on this. So these interviews better be well prepared and meaningful.

Just like we had our questions ready in the online form, we should have a separate list of questions ready for the video interview to make sure each chat is as objective as possible. There should be also a hard time limit for each video call. Usually we set it to one hour.

### Step 5. Test project

After the interviews the team chooses at least 2 best candidates for the job and offers them a gig.

Over the years hiring remotely we realized that talking about work is nice, but really letting someone do the work and see them in action is so much better. This gives us a chance to get to know how the person is really working. What they really know and what their skills really are. And most of all, how they communicate with us.

We appreciate people's time and we don't ask anyone to work for free so this test project is a paid gig. Also, the candidate is usually already working somewhere full time, so the project must be something they can do in a span of a few days, dedicating 2-3 hours a day in the afternoon after they've finished their current job. For the test project we're usually choosing something really practical. As we'll be paying for it, we might as well use it in the future.

### Step 6. Offer and an interview with the boss.

After the test project, the team ultimately decides who they want to hire. They choose the winner and they send them a job offer based on our Salary Formula (as explained in Chapter 13). When they accept the offer, we schedule a second video interview  with them. This time with the CEO (that's me!) and the person who's been running the recruitment process from our side. Usually that's my assistant and this book's co-author, Magda.

The goal of this video interview is to check for the personality of the candidate and get them excited about working in our company. Usually this interview is just a nice formality and it gives me (the CEO) an idea who we're hiring. Before we start really working together I want to try to get to know the person a little deeper, figure out their hopes and dreams and see if they are really looking forward to working in our team.

### Step 7. In-person meeting with someone from our team.

If there aren't any red flags and everything went smoothly, we figure out who from our all-remote team leaves the closest to the candidate and we ask them to meet them in person. This one person from our team invites the candidate for a lunch or coffee on company's dime, checks in person their ID to make sure that they are who they say they are. This is the final step of our hiring process and unless this person doesn't turn out to be a complete weirdo, they've got themselves a new job!

### Step 8. Onboarding process for the 3-month trial period.

Now that we've hired the candidate and they started work, we should have an onboarding process ready for them. We've got an entire onboarding article with links to videos and screencasts they should watch as well as their first tasks to do. It's important to give them a light assignment early in the process so they have a nice balance of work, setting up their accounts and access points, while also reading about the company and watching instructional videos.

Throughout the first week their team leader is meeting them every day for a few minutes via video to catch up and assist them, answering any questions they will have.

We usually sign a 3-month trial period with each candidate. This way we have more than 12 weeks of real work with the person to really figure out if they're truly the right fit for us. As the trial period goes, we give them feedback, start challenging them with more and more complicated tasks and see how they perform. Usually after 10 full weeks with us we give ourselves the moment to assess their work and make a conscious decision if the person should stay with us or go.

### Step 9. Next 9 months with full perks.

Now that the person is fully on
