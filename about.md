## Your host - Michael Sliwinski

Hi, I'm [Michael Sliwinski](https://sliwinski.com/) and I'm the [founder and CEO](https://nozbe.com/michael) of [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/) - a to-do app for teams. We're a team of [25 people who work completely remotely from their 25 "home offices"](https://nozbe.com/about) and we've been doing this for the last 12+ years now. Nozbe has more than 500K users from all over the world.

## Our project - the #NoOffice book

Whenever I talk to people about my app and my team people don't believe we can be successful at running an "all remote company". They keep asking *"where are you based?"*, *"where's your office?"*... and when I tell them about our remote team they keep repeating that *"while it might work for you, it will definitely not work for us"*... like if my team were a snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è or a unicorn ü¶Ñ or something.

That's why I decided to start working on this book - [No Office](/book) - because I believe *work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do* and an office is just a tool which is not mandatory to be running a successful business.

The idea is to gather all the best pieces of advice on running an all-remote team. Based on my experience running Nozbe and inspired by other remotely working teams.

Actually the goal is bigger - I think this book will be a sound business advice for any type of business - remote or not. Because what works for an all-remote team can substantially improve operation of a team that does have an office.

## The book is free and your contributions are welcome!
