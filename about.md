## Your host - Michael Sliwinski

Hi, I'm [Michael Sliwinski](https://sliwinski.com/) and I'm the [founder and CEO](https://nozbe.com/michael) of [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/) - a to-do app for teams. We're a team of [25 people who work completely remotely from their 25 "home offices"](https://nozbe.com/about) and we've been doing this for the last 12+ years now. Nozbe has more than 0.5M users from all over the world.

## Our project - No Office book

Whenever I talk to people about my app and my team people don't believe we can be successful at running an "all remote company". They keep asking *"where are you based?"*, *"where's your office?"*... and when I tell them about our remote team they keep repeating that *"while it might work for you, it will definitely not work for us"*... like if my team were a snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è or a unicorn ü¶Ñ or something.

That's why I decided to start working on this book - No Office - because I believe *work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do* and an office is just a tool which is not mandatory to be running a successful business.

In this book my idea is to gather all the best pieces of advice on running an all-remote team. Based on my experience and inspired by other remotely working teams.

Actually the goal is bigger - I think this book will be a sound business advice for any type of business - remote or not. Because what works for a remotely working team, definitely works for a team that does have an office.

## I want you to help me contribute!

I'll be openly writing this book here.

Check out [Table of Contents](/book) and see that whenever I write a chapter it'll be published and linked here. The book will be free for you to read.

And it's published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Nozbe/NoOffice.org) so feel free to send your pull requests and comments and suggestions.

Let's write this book together!
