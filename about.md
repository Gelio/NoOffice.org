Hello, I'm Michael and I'm writing this book, because I want everyone to understand that:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

## Michael Sliwinski - author

Professionally, I'm [Michael Sliwinski](https://michael.team/) and I'm the [founder and CEO](https://nozbe.com/michael) of [Nozbe and Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/) - to-do apps for busy professionals and modern teams.

> Basically our apps make people and teams awesome by giving them more time to do what's important.

I'm leading a team of [25 people who work completely remotely from their 25 "home offices"](https://nozbe.com/about) and we've been doing this for the last 13+ years now. Nozbe has more than 700K users from all over the world.

## Magda B≈Çaszczyk - editor and co-author

Magda is content curator at [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/) and she's the editor of our [Nozbe blog](https://nozbe.com/blog). She's also coordinating all translations on our multi-language web site. In the past she was the chief editor of [Productive! Magazine](http://productivemag.com) until it we both decided to stop publishing it in 2016. She's been the editor of my past books: [It's all about Passion!](https://sliwinski.com/passion), [No Office Apps](https://sliwinski.com/apps) and most recently [10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity](https://productivitycourse.com) (also in [Polish](https://KursProduktywnosci.pl)).

Magda is my trusted editor, and text-sparing-partner. She revises all of my writing and challenges me to write better. Magda and I have been working together since 2013 and she's my right-hand person when it comes to writing. Without her this project wouldn't have had a chance to succeed.

Apart from editing and writing, she's also coordinating the translations of the book to Polish (where she's also the editor), Spanish and Japanese.

## Our project - the #NoOffice book

Whenever I talk to people about my app and my team people don't believe we can be successful at running an "all remote company". They keep asking *"where are you based?"*, *"where's your office?"*... and when I tell them about our remote team they keep repeating that *"while it might work for you, it will definitely not work for us"*... like if my team were a snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è or a unicorn ü¶Ñ or something.

That's why I decided to start working on this book - [No Office](/book) - because I believe *work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do* and an office is just a tool which is not mandatory to be running a successful business.

The idea is to gather all the best pieces of advice on running an all-remote team. Based on my experience running Nozbe and inspired by other remotely working teams.

Actually the goal is bigger - I think this book will be a sound business advice for any type of business - remote or not. Because what works for an all-remote team can substantially improve operation of a team that does have an office.

## The book is free and your contributions are welcome!

Together with Magda, I'm openly writing this book here. Expect weekly(ish) updates from me here.

* Check out [Table of Contents](/book)
* Add pull requests and comments on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nozbe/NoOffice.org)
* The book and the site are [licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0](/license)

## Translations

Once the book's version 1.0 is finished in English, we'll be welcoming translations to as many languages as possible!

We're spearheading this effort by sponsoring the translations to Polish, Spanish and Japanese.

## Meet the entire #NoOffice book team

Apart from me and Magda, here are more people who help us make this book a reality:

### Editors:

- Daniella, our US-based English editor. She makes sure what we write makes sense in American English. After all, English is NOT our mother tongue.
- Dominika, responsible for Spanish-speaking customers at Nozbe, is the editor of the Spanish translation of #NoOffice book.
- Martyna, responsible for Japanese and Korean-speaking customers at Nozbe, is the editor of the Japanese translation of #NoOffice book.

### Translators:

- Kasia is translating the book to Polish
- Maria is translating the book to Spanish
- Keisuke is translating the book to Japanese

## Technical stuff

If you're interested, here are some technical details about the whole book-writing process:

* This book is being written [in Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* The site is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* [It's all done on the iPad](/why-in-any-company-you-should-be-using-version-control-for-anything-how-we-use-github-not-only-bc2554308455/) using the following apps working together: [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) for GitHub support, [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for content and [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) for code.
* As the entire book is [published on GitHub](https://github.com/Nozbe/NoOffice.org) and we collaborate on text directly there. When you review commits on GitHub you'll see that once I've finished a draft of a book, Magda directly pulls it from there, edits it and commits back. All our edits are done out in the open. Feel free to contributed.
* We coordinate all book writing using both [Nozbe Personal and Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/).

Let's write this book together!
