Hello, I'm Michael and I'm writing this book because there's one thing I want everyone to understand:

> Work is not a place to go; it's a thing you do.

## Michael Sliwinski ‚Äì Author

Professionally, I'm [Michael Sliwinski](https://michael.team/) and I'm the [founder and CEO](https://nozbe.com/michael) of [Nozbe and Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/) ‚Äì to-do apps for busy professionals and modern teams.

> Essentially, our apps make people and teams awesome by giving them more time to do what's important.

I'm leading a team of [25 people who work completely remotely from their 25 "home offices"](https://nozbe.com/about), and we've been doing this since 2007. Now, Nozbe has more than 600K users from all over the world.

On GitHub, I'm [@MichaelNozbe](https://github.com/michaelnozbe).

## Magda B≈Çaszczyk ‚Äì Editor and co-author

Magda is the content curator at [Nozbe](https://nozbe.com/) and the editor of our [Nozbe blog](https://nozbe.com/blog). She also coordinates all translations of our multi-language website. In the past, she was the Chief Editor of [Productive! Magazine](http://productivemag.com) until our last publication in 2016. She's been the editor of my past books: [It's all about Passion!](https://sliwinski.com/passion), [No Office Apps](https://sliwinski.com/apps) and most recently [10 Steps to Ultimate Productivity](https://productivitycourse.com) (also in [Polish](https://KursProduktywnosci.pl)).

Magda is my trusted editor and text-sparing-partner. She revises all of my writing and challenges me to write even better. Magda and I have been working together since 2013, and she's my right-hand person when it comes to writing. Without her, this project wouldn't have a chance to succeed.

Apart from editing and writing, she is also coordinating the translations of this book to Polish (where she's also the editor) and other languages.

On GitHub, she's [@blamagda](https://github.com/blamagda).

## Our project ‚Äì the #NoOffice book

Whenever I talk to people about my app and my team, people don't believe are successful in running an all-remote company. They always ask: "Where are you based?" or "Where's your office?". When I tell them about our remote team, they say something along the lines of: "While it might work for you, it will definitely not work for us‚Ä¶" ‚Äì as if my team is a snowflake ‚ùÑÔ∏è or a unicorn ü¶Ñ or something!

That's why I decided to start working on this book, [No Office](/book). I believe *work is not a place to go; it's a thing you do*, and an office is simply a tool that is completely non-essential to run a successful business.

The idea is to gather and present all my best pieces of advice on running an all-remote team based on my experience managing Nozbe and inspired by other remote teams.

In fact, my goal for this book is even bigger ‚Äì I believe this book provides sound business advice for any type of business, whether or not it's remote. What works for an all-remote team can substantially improve the operation of a team that does have an office.

## Contributors

## Technical stuff

If you're interested, here are some technical details about the book-writing process:

* This book is being written [in Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
* The site is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* [It's all done on the iPad](/why-in-any-company-you-should-be-using-version-control-for-anything-how-we-use-github-not-only-bc2554308455/) using the following apps working together: [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) for GitHub support, [IA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for content and [Textastic](https://www.textasticapp.com/) for code.
* The entire book is [published on GitHub](https://github.com/Nozbe/NoOffice.org), and we collaborate on text directly there. When you review commits on GitHub, you'll see that once I've finished a draft of a book, Magda directly pulls it from there, edits it and commits back. She also updates every chapter after it's proofread by Daniella. All our edits are done out in the open. Feel free to contribute.
* We coordinate all book-writing using both [Nozbe Personal and Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com/).

Let's write this book together!
