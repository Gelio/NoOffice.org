## A successful company does not need an office as much as it thinks it does.

This book isn't aimed only at people and teams interested in remote work. It's based on more than a decade of experience running an all-remote company but as you'll see in the upcoming chapters, my main argument is that an office is not a requirement for a business to be successful. Yes, an office can be a useful tool, but it's completely optional. What really matters is the way you're working together in a team towards common goals. Because:

> Work is not a place to go, it's a thing that you do.

After the [acknowledgements](/book/acknowledgements) please go straight to [Introduction](/book/introduction) where you'll learn the main premise of this book - that you can run a very successful company with or without an office. Good luck!
